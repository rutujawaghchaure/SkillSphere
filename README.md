## 🧩 Overview

The **Skill Swap Platform** is a mini web application that allows users to list skills they can offer and request skills they want to learn or receive help with. It facilitates skill exchange through user-generated listings, swap requests, and feedback mechanisms — promoting a collaborative learning environment.
